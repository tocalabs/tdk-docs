# String

## Definition
A `String`, or `Text` type as it is more commonly referred to, is one of the most simple types in the ecosystem and is defined as the [string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=net-6.0) base type in C#.

## Methods

There are no methods on it but all standard `string` extensions and methods can be used on it.
```csharp
var myString = "Toca Development Kit"; // Considered a String type in Toca
myString = myString.ToLower(); // We can call regular string methods on this as expected
```
